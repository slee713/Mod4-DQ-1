Each person in your group should take one of the following topics and explain it to the group in their own words. For the remaining topics, discuss them as a whole group:

* Components
* Node Package Manager
* JSX
* Static Components vs. Dynamic Components
* Imports and Exports
* Props

After you are finished, come up with at least 3 questions on topics you’re still trying to understand and bring those to lecture.
